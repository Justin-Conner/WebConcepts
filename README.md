# WebConcepts
Here we are exploring the different concepts in web development for HTML and CSS.If you are new to HTML and CSS you can follow along and open each file to view it's contents.If you opened this README.md file you will notice that what is in here is different than what you see on GitHub (if the file is not opened). That is because you can you "Mark down". Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows users to write and format text using simple syntax. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 as a way to write content for the web that is easy to read and write, and that can be easily converted to HTML.

Markdown uses plain text with a few simple characters to indicate formatting, such as headers, lists, and emphasis. For example, an asterisk (*) can be used to indicate emphasis (italics), two asterisks (**) can be used for bold text, and a hash symbol (#) can be used to indicate headers.

One of the benefits of using Markdown is that it is very simple and easy to learn, yet it can be used to create complex documents with advanced formatting. Additionally, because Markdown is plain text, it can be easily read and edited by humans and computers, making it a popular choice for writing content for the web, documentation, and other types of text-based documents.

Markdown is supported by many different platforms and applications, including GitHub, Reddit, and Slack, and it can be converted to other formats, such as HTML or PDF, using tools like Pandoc or markdown-it.

While opening a file  will allow you to see it's contents if you want to get your hands dirty follow steps below.
- Step 1 is to clone this repo so that you have it locally on your PC.
  -You need to fork the repo to have a copy on your GitHub account you can find instructions on that here [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) 
  - follow this link to get the step by step procedure on how to clone from GitHub [Clone a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
Once you have a copy on your local machine it is easy to right click on a file with an HTML extension and open in your choice of browser or code editor.
Another option is to click on the link provided in the HTML file that will take you to an in browser coding experience at [Replit website](https://replit.com/). If you can't wait to get started this is the fastest option and it also allows you to "push" to your GitHub with a few clicks.
Another option is to code in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code you can find instructions on how to get started with that here [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
That's the quick and dirty on your Web Dev journey. TO THE MOON!
