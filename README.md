# WebConcepts
Here we are exploring the different concepts in web development for HTML and CSS.If you are new to HTML and CSS you can follow along and open each file to view it's contents.If you opened this README.md file you will notice that what is in here is different than what you see on GitHub (if the file is not opened). That is because you can you are using "Mark down". Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows users to write and format text using simple syntax. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 as a way to write content for the web that is easy to read and write, and that can be easily converted to HTML.  Check out this GitHub pageon the topic [Mark down cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Markdown uses plain text with a few simple characters to indicate formatting, such as headers, lists, and emphasis. For example, an asterisk (*) can be used to indicate emphasis (italics), two asterisks (**) can be used for bold text, and a hash symbol (#) can be used to indicate headers.

One of the benefits of using Markdown is that it is very simple and easy to learn, yet it can be used to create complex documents with advanced formatting. Additionally, because Markdown is plain text, it can be easily read and edited by humans and computers, making it a popular choice for writing content for the web, documentation, and other types of text-based documents.

Markdown is supported by many different platforms and applications, including GitHub, Reddit, and Slack, and it can be converted to other formats, such as HTML or PDF, using tools like Pandoc or markdown-it.

So here we are on our journey to be a real developer.  A few words of advice before embarking a the most rewarding, challenging and fun adventure you have ever been on.  You will need to market your skills, reinforce them (making tutorials), sharpen them (practice practice practice) and gain new skills.
A good idea is to have a set of social media accounts at your beck and call. Why? They are a good source of information, good for networking and plain entertaining at times. Here are the accounts I reccomend.

-LinkedIn (find mentors, learn and so much more) 
-Twitter (get the latest and greatest and maybe some shit posts lto entertain you. lol)
-Meet up (phone app for finding coding events)
-Slack (a good way to form groups once you make coding friends and you might use it at work once you get a job)
-discord (same applies here)
-Google (seems obvious but if you don't have a gmail you are missing out. Free drive for backups, word processing and much more)
-youtube (when you learn something new make a video to reinforce that learning and maybe help some else out?)
-Godaddy (you want to be a Dev? You need a website of course. Buy a domain and update your site with new info frequently)

For more detail on social media and a good strategy for success see my social_media README.md file.

While opening a file  will allow you to see it's contents if you want to get your hands dirty follow steps below.
- Step 1 is to clone this repo so that you have it locally on your PC.
  -You need to fork the repo to have a copy on your GitHub account you can find instructions on that here [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) 
  - follow this link to get the step by step procedure on how to clone from GitHub [Clone a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
Once you have a copy on your local machine you have some options on how to start coding.
-It is easy to right click on a file with an HTML extension and open in your choice of browser or code editor.
-Another option is to click on the link provided in the HTML file that will take you to an in browser coding experience at [Replit website](https://replit.com/). If you can't wait to get started this is the fastest option and it also allows you to "push" to your GitHub with a few clicks.
=Another option is to code in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code. 
    -You can find instructions on how to get started. with that here [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
That's the quick and dirty on your Web Dev journey. TO THE MOON!
