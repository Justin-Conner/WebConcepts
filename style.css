/* In this code, we've added a display: flex and justify-content: space-between property to the nav selector to make sure all the nav elements are in a single row and are spaced evenly between the left and right edges of the screen.

We've also added the margin: 0 and padding: 0 properties to the nav ul element to remove any default margins or padding.

To style the #nav-left and #nav-right elements differently, we've added the justify-content: flex-start and justify-content: flex-end properties, respectively.

Finally, we've added some styles to the nav ul li a selector to change the color and font weight of the links in the navigation.

With these changes, all the nav elements should be in a single row, and the id selectors should still be used to apply special styling to the #nav-left and #nav-right elements.*/
