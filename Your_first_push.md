So you have written some HTML and CSS. Congrats! now is the time to save your work. This is important to keep what you have done and avoid a concept known as "regression".  If you become a professional developer making this mistake can not only effect you but all your team members, so it is best to start off with a good habit. You can thank me later for this one. wink wink.

Regression happens when you make some good progress but perhaps you "over do it" and mess up all your progress and it can take some time in many cases to fix what you messed up.  To save your work to the [GitHub Version Control System](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). 
Now before you go pushing your hard work to the "main" branch it is a good idea to create a branch off of main first.  Main is as it implies, the unadultered version of all your hard work.  
In order to avoid messing up your important "save point". [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
You can use the [GUI](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5435/graphical-user-interface-gui)to do this or through the [CLI](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3337/command-line-interface-cli)
I like to make a branch called "staging" you can push your new code to this branch and not mess up the main branch. You can make as many changes to your code as you want and keep main "safe".  In this particular instance I am pushing all the work I did to make index.html before I journey on to make the other files that will hold the more detailed version of the descriptions that are in the header part of the [index.html](https://github.com/Justin-Conner/WebConcepts/blob/main/index.html) page.
