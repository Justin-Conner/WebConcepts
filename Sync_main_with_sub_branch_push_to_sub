To sync a Git branch with the main branch and add files from main to the sub-branch, you can use the following steps:

-git checkout sub-branch
-git pull origin main
-git merge main
-git cherry-pick main <file-path>
-git commit -m "Sync sub-branch with main branch and add files"
-git push origin sub-branch
